# Kubernetes Orchestration Introduction Project

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning orchestration using **Kubernetes** through **Minikube**, a lightweight version of Kubernetes. The primary resource I am using to guide my learning is a tutorial from the [TechWorld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWorldwithNana) YouTube channel.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to develop a deep understanding of Kubernetes concepts, including container orchestration, by using Minikube. Through this tutorial, I'm going to:

- Installe **Minikube** and **cubectl** on a Redhat 8 linux server (virtual machine).
- Deploye a MongoDB database and a web app on a **Minikube** node.

## Learning Resource
- [TechWorld with Nana YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_o8dwzRlu4&pp=ygU0S3ViZXJuZXRlcyBDcmFzaCBDb3Vyc2UgZm9yIEFic29sdXRlIEJlZ2lubmVycyBbTkVXXQ%3D%3D)

## What You'll Find in This Repository
As I follow the tutorial, this repository will be updated with:
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- Deployments

## Future Goals
Once I complete this tutorial and gain experience with Minikube, I plan to apply Kubernetes knowledge to larger-scale projects and real-world use cases, including cluster management and application orchestration in production environments.

Stay tuned for updates as I progress!
