# Kubernetes Orchestration Learning Project

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning orchestration using **Kubernetes** through **Minikube**, a lightweight version of Kubernetes. The primary resource I am using to guide my learning is a tutorial from the **TechWorld with Nana** YouTube channel.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to develop a deep understanding of Kubernetes concepts, including container orchestration, by using Minikube for local development and testing. Through this tutorial, I aim to learn:

- Deploying applications on Minikube
- Managing pods, services, and deployments
- Scaling and updating applications
- Networking and other Kubernetes functionalities

## Learning Resource
- [TechWorld with Nana YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWorldwithNana)

## What You'll Find in This Repository
As I follow the tutorial, this repository will be updated with:
- Minikube configuration files
- Kubernetes manifests (YAML files)
- Key notes, exercises, and examples related to orchestrating applications

## Future Goals
Once I complete this tutorial and gain experience with Minikube, I plan to apply Kubernetes knowledge to larger-scale projects and real-world use cases, including cluster management and application orchestration in production environments.

Stay tuned for updates as I progress!
